1.0 Introduction.

1.1 Background.
The initial requirement is to develop a comprehensive Product Management system that adheres to TMForum standards. ProdigyHub was conceived to address the growing need for standardized product lifecycle management across telecommunications and service provider industries. The system needs to manage product catalogs, ordering processes, inventory tracking, and customer qualifications in a unified platform. Since modern enterprises require real-time data synchronization and seamless integration across multiple systems, it is necessary to have one centralized system to handle all product management operations efficiently.

1.2 Overview.
ProdigyHub is an enterprise-grade product management platform that implements multiple TMForum Open API standards to provide comprehensive product lifecycle management. The system serves telecommunications companies, service providers, and enterprise organizations by offering standardized APIs for product catalog management, ordering workflows, inventory tracking, qualification processes, event management, and product configuration. Currently, the system operates as a unified web application with real-time dashboards and automated workflows. The platform eliminates the manual overhead of managing complex product portfolios and enables seamless integration with existing enterprise systems through standardized TMForum APIs.


1.3 Proposal.

The proposal for developing ProdigyHub is to modernize traditional product management approaches by implementing industry-standard TMForum APIs in a unified platform. The system aims to provide automated product catalog management, streamlined ordering processes, real-time inventory tracking, and comprehensive qualification workflows. Another key aspect of the software is to generate automated reports, enable real-time monitoring, and support enterprise-level integrations through standardized API endpoints.


1.4 Objectives.

? To develop an automated product catalog management system following the TMF620 standards.
? To streamline product ordering workflows with the TMF622 implementation.
? To enable real-time inventory tracking through TMF637 integration
? To automate product qualification processes using TMF679 standards.
? To implement comprehensive event management via TMF688.
? To provide advanced product configuration capabilities through TMF760
? To minimize manual operational overhead through automation
? To ensure standardized API compliance for enterprise integrations
? To reduce time-to-market for new product offerings
? To enable real-time monitoring and analytics across all product operations

1.5 Scope.
The scope of ProdigyHub encompasses a comprehensive product management ecosystem built on TMForum standards. The system is developed as a modern web application with both frontend dashboards and backend API services. It operates across the entire product lifecycle from catalog creation to order fulfillment and inventory management.
